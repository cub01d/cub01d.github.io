        ABSTRACT
            In the typical Drunken Sailor problem, a drunken sailor is placed as in the center of a pier.
            With an equal probability of going north, south, east, or west, he takes a random step in one of 
            those directions. The question is: how long will it take before he falls off the pier? In this 
            experiment, we examine the distance between the origin, where two different types of 
            walkers are initially placed, and final position of the walkers, after allowing the walkers to 
            randomly move a certain number of steps. Using Monte Carlo methods,
            we note the average distance over many trials and fit a regression
            curve relating the number of steps taken with the final distance. 

        INTRODUCTION

            In our experiment, we introduce two varieties of walkers. The first one, the LatticeWalker
            , is the most similar to the drunken sailor. Our LatticeWalker takes a single step up, 
            down, left, or right at every epoch,
            and can walk only on lattice points. The second one, the AngledWalker,
            takes its name from its ability 
            to take a step in a direction denoted by an integral number of degrees (0-360). With both of these 
            walker objects, we hypothesize that the mean distance from the origin is related to the square root
            of the number of steps taken.

        PROBLEM STATEMENT
            Given the number of steps taken from the origin as the independent variable, find the average distance from the origin.

        EXPERIMENT
            We conducted this experiment with a Monte Carlo simulation implemented in Python 2, using 
            Matplotlib to display our graphs. We first defined walker, field, and location classes, 
            and then LatticeWalker and AngledWalker subclasses inherited from the walker class, with 
            movement methods and distance metrics defined to keep track of the data.
            

            The data were collected from n=0 to n=1000 steps. For each step n, 100 trials were performed (figures 1 and 4). 
            We transformed our data into to fit a power regression, and then used linear least-squares for our regression line
            (figures 2 and 5). We transformed the regression line back into the original input space. 
            The r-values and r<sup>2</sup>-values are provided below as well as the data.</p>

        <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>
            <p>From our r<sup>2</sup> value, we conclude that the 95% of the variation in the mean distance 
            from the origin is explained in our model by the variation in the number of steps taken. With an exponent 
            close to 0.5, our LSRL approximates a square-root relation. Because the data points represent mean 
            values, it is expected that the individual values will differ more. However, upon inspection of the 
            residual plots, we see that the data fit a triangular pattern, having a wider spread as the number 
            of steps increases on the right, and having less spread as the number of steps decreases on the left.
            This is partly explained due to the fact that our number of trials was kept constant (100) whereas the 
            number of steps taken gradually increased. To accomodate, we should have increased the number of
            trials for the data to better fit the curve. As a result, when the number of steps taken increased,
            the spread of the data increased as well.
